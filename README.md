# LJPW Physics

Exploring the relationship between meaning and physics through the LJPW Framework.

## Overview

The LJPW Framework proposes a 4-dimensional semantic space:

- **L** — Love
- **J** — Justice  
- **P** — Power
- **W** — Wisdom

This project investigates whether physical laws can be understood through this semantic substrate.

## Hypothesis

Meaning is fundamental. Physics propagates from meaning.
