# LJPW Application Note: The Power Algorithm (Autopoietic Engineering)

## 1. The Core Principle: The Power Algorithm
**Formula:** $P(t) = S_0 \cdot \lim_{n \to \infty} (1 + \frac{1}{n})^{n \cdot t}$

**Semantic Definition:** Power is not Force; Power is **Retention**.
*   **Old Paradigm (Entropic):** Source $\to$ Flow $\to$ Exhaust. (Maximize Output).
*   **New Paradigm (Autopoietic):** Input $\to$ Sink (Retention) $\to$ Compounding $\to$ Overflow. (Maximize Internal State).

The "Easter Egg" of $e$ ($0.718...$) teaches that **Infinite Power** comes from the continuous reinvestment of small fractions ($1/n$) of output back into the system's own structure.

## 2. Mechanical Application: The Autopoietic Engine
**Target:** Steam Engines, Rockets, Thermodynamics.
**Problem:** Standard engines are "Pass-Through" systems that dump latent heat as waste (Entropy).
**LJPW Solution:** The Regenerative "Sink" Cycle.

### The Mechanism
1.  **Capture (Sink):** Do not condense exhaust steam to liquid. Capture it as low-pressure gas.
2.  **Reinvestment ($1/n$):** Divert a fraction of output power to drive a **Mechanical Vapor Recompressor (MVR)**.
3.  **Compounding:** Compress the exhaust back to high-pressure/temperature state and inject it back into the boiler.
    *   *Result:* The engine "eats its own exhaust" to upgrade its baseline state ($S_0$).
4.  **Constraint (Justice):** As Energy Density rises exponentially, structural containment (Justice) must actively scale (e.g., magnetic confinement, variable geometry) to prevent explosion.

## 3. Financial Application: The Autopoietic Loan
**Target:** Banking, Mortgages, Wealth Management.
**Problem:** Standard loans are "Extraction" relationships. The borrower is drained to Zero.
**LJPW Solution:** The Self-Extinguishing Debt (Asset Generation).

### The Mechanism
**Structure:** Payment = Interest + Principal + **Retention ($1/n$)**

1.  **The Retention Premium:** A small fractional payment (e.g., 5% or "Round-up") is added to every installment.
2.  **The Sink (Invested Collateral):** This premium is **not** used to pay down debt immediately. It is locked in a High-Yield, Low-Risk Investment Vehicle (The Sink).
3.  **The Crossover:**
    *   Debt decreases linearly (Amortization).
    *   Sink grows exponentially (Compound Interest).
    *   **Result:** A mathematical point exists where **Sink Yield > Loan Interest**.
4.  **Outcome:** The borrower does not just reach Zero. They exit the contract with a cash-generating asset. The "Borrower" evolves into a "Client."

### LJPW Dimensional Analysis
*   **Power ($P$):** Compounding Asset Growth.
*   **Justice ($J$):** Risk Mitigation. As Sink grows, Net Exposure $\to$ 0.
*   **Wisdom ($W$):** Integration. Middleware connects "Lending" and "Wealth" silos.
*   **Love ($L$):** Customer Alignment. The bank builds the customer, rather than consuming them.

## 4. The Ontology of "Sink" Engineering
In this framework, a **Sink** is not negative. It is the prerequisite for existence.
*   **Entropy:** Taking to consume (Destruction).
*   **Autopoiesis:** Taking to build capacity (Construction).

**The Engineer's Mandate:** Design systems that prioritize **Internal Structural Reinforcement** over External Output.
