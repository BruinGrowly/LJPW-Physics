# LJPW Framework Version Guide
### *Navigation for Understanding the Framework Evolution*

**Purpose:** This guide helps readers understand which version of the framework to read based on their interests and how the framework has evolved.

---

## Quick Start: Which Version Should I Read?

| Your Interest | Recommended Version | Why |
|---------------|---------------------|-----|
| **Complete current framework** | **V7.3** | Most comprehensive, architecturally complete, stress-tested |
| **Number theory & primes** | V7.2 or V7.3 | V7.2 introduces foundations, V7.3 adds architectural model |
| **2+2 structure & conjugate duality** | V7.1+ | Introduced in V7.1, refined in subsequent versions |
| **Original unified framework** | V7.0 | First complete synthesis (if available) |
| **Just the essentials** | V7.3 Parts I-V | Foundation sections cover core principles |

**TL;DR: Start with V7.3 (`LJPW_FRAMEWORK_V7.3_COMPLETE_UNIFIED_PLUS.md`) unless you have a specific reason to explore earlier versions.**

## Version Evolution Timeline

### V7.0: Initial Unified Framework (Foundation)
**Status:** Base framework
**Key Contributions:**
- Established the four dimensions: Love (L), Justice (J), Power (P), Wisdom (W)
- Defined the coupling matrix (κ) showing Love as source, Power as sink
- Introduced phase transitions: Entropic → Homeostatic → Autopoietic
- Natural equilibrium points (0.618, 0.414, 0.718, 0.693)
- Law of Karma (state-dependent coupling)

**Core Equation:**
```
dS/dt = κ(H) · ∇U(S)
```

### V7.1: 2+2 Structure & Conjugate Duality
**Status:** Dimensional refinement
**Key Contributions:**
- Revealed 2+2 structure: Only P and W are truly fundamental
- L and J emerge from P-W conjugate relationship
- Introduced conjugate duality: ΔP·ΔW ≥ ℏ_semantic
- Uncertainty principle in semantic space
- Demonstrated why 4D appears but only 2D is fundamental

**Core Insight:**
```
L = φ · W  (Love emerges from Wisdom)
J = φ · P⁻¹ (Justice emerges from inverse Power)
```

### V7.2: Number Theory Foundations (December 2025, Early)
**Status:** Mathematical-semantic integration
**File:** `LJPW_FRAMEWORK_V7.2_COMPLETE_UNIFIED_PLUS.md` (97KB, 3086 lines)

**Key Contributions:**
- **Part XVIII:** Prime Semantic Foundations — Primes are Justice-crystals
- **Part XIX:** Mathematical Pointer to Semantics — Reading the shadow
- **Part XX:** Deep Mathematical-Semantic Structure — Geometry of meaning
- **Part XXI:** Number Theory Implications — Goldbach, Twin Primes, Riemann
- Established that mathematics is derivative of semantics
- Showed primes as irreducible meaning-atoms in number form

**Paradigm Shift:**
```
OLD: Mathematics → Physics → Consciousness → Meaning
NEW: MEANING → Mathematics → Physics → Matter → Consciousness
```

### V7.3: Architectural Ontology (December 2025, Late) ⭐ CURRENT
**Status:** Architecturally complete, stress-tested
**File:** `LJPW_FRAMEWORK_V7.3_COMPLETE_UNIFIED_PLUS.md` (114KB, 3546 lines)

**New in V7.3 — Book Six: Bricks & Mortar:**
- **Part XXIII:** Primes as Bricks — Building blocks of existence
- **Part XXIV:** Love as Mortar — The binding force
- **Part XXV:** φ as Blueprint — Universal proportion
- **Part XXVI:** Stress Testing the Foundation — 7 challenges (6/7 passed)
- **Part XXVII:** The Unified Reality Model — Semantic-Mathematical-Physical integration

**The Architectural Model:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BRICKS:  Primes / Justice-crystals     │
│           (Irreducible foundations)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  MORTAR:  Love / Coupling               │
│           (Binding force)                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  BLUEPRINT: φ / Constants               │
│           (Proportional guidance)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Cross-Domain Unification:**

| Domain | Bricks | Mortar | Blueprint |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Semantic** | L, J, P, W | Love coupling (κ) | Natural equilibria |
| **Mathematical** | 2, 3, 5, 7... | Multiplication (×) | φ = 1.618... |
| **Physical** | Quarks, leptons | Forces | Physical constants |

**Stress Test Results:**
- ✓ Irrational numbers (they're mortar specifications)
- ✓ Zero and negatives (meta-concepts, not bricks)
- ⚠️ Continuum (may be discrete at Planck scale)
- ✓ Complex numbers (Gaussian primes extend structure)
- ✓ Infinity (inexhaustible supply of Justice)
- ✓ Semantic prime uniqueness (2+2 strengthens claim)
- ✓ Circularity (external validation + self-consistency)

**Key Advancement:**
V7.3 transitions from describing **WHAT** reality is to explaining **HOW** reality is constructed.

## Cumulative vs Delta

Each version is **cumulative** — V7.3 includes all content from V7.2, which includes V7.1, etc.

**If you only read one document, read V7.3.** It contains the complete, current framework.

Earlier versions are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding evolution of ideas
- Tracking theoretical development
- Academic citation purposes

## Questions?

**Q: Do I need to read all versions?**
A: No. V7.3 is complete and cumulative.

**Q: What's the difference between V7.2 and V7.3?**
A: V7.2 establishes number theory foundations. V7.3 adds architectural ontology (Bricks & Mortar model) and stress testing.

**Q: Which version is peer-reviewed?**
A: None yet — this is a working research framework. Validation comes from empirical testing and self-consistency.

**Q: Can I cite an earlier version?**
A: Yes, but cite V7.3 as the current definitive reference unless you specifically need an earlier formulation.

**Q: Will there be a V7.4?**
A: Only if significant new discoveries warrant it. V7.3 is considered architecturally complete.
